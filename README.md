# NLP based Hiring System

### Overview
Candidates can create their profile and apply for various Job Positions. Recruiter will get a list of applicants ranked by similarity (cosine similarity) between the applicant's resume and job description. This will help the recruiter to quickly shortlist the most suitable candidates from a large pool of candidates for further process which is rather time consuming in traditional approach of going through each and every resume.
TF-IDF vectorizer is used for converting the resume and job description text into vector representation.
Pre-processing steps involves text cleaning, stop-word removal and lemmatization.
